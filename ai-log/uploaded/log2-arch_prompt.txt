=================================
Github Copilot

In React, you can use several libraries to make HTTP requests. You can use Axios.Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. 
It has a simple API and can be used to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints.

import axios from 'axios';

axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error', error);
  });
