How to implement redirect(url_for) while wanting to return json data in flask?

In Flask, redirect(url_for('view')) is used to redirect the user to a different endpoint. However, this is typically used for server-side rendered applications where the server is responsible for rendering the views.

In your case, since you're returning JSON responses, it seems like you're building a RESTful API where the client (e.g., a JavaScript frontend) is responsible for rendering the views and handling the navigation.

In a RESTful API, you typically wouldn't perform redirects on the server. Instead, you would return a specific status code and message, and the client would be responsible for interpreting this response and performing the appropriate action (e.g., redirecting the user to a different page).

Here's an example of how you can modify your login route to return a specific status code and message when the login fails:

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.json.get('username', None)
    password = request.json.get('password', None)
    if username != 'test' or password != 'test':
        return jsonify({"msg": "Login failed", "redirect": "login"}), 401

    user = User(id=1)
    login_user(user)
    token = create_access_token(identity=user.id)
    return jsonify({"msg": "Login successful", "token": token}), 200

In this code, when the login fails, the server returns a 401 status code (which stands for "Unauthorized") and a JSON response with a message and a redirect field indicating where the client should redirect the user.

Then, on the client side, you would check the status code and the redirect field of the response, and redirect the user to the appropriate page. The implementation of this would depend on the technology you're using on the client side (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).
