Help me create a bash testing script for the command line interface of my webapp called cli.py

Creating a Bash script to test a command line interface (CLI) for a web application is a straightforward process that involves executing your CLI commands within the script and checking the output or return status to verify correct behavior. Below is a basic template you can customize for testing your `cli.py` Python script. This template includes comments to guide you through customizing the script for your specific tests.

### Step 1: Create the Bash Script

Open your preferred text editor or IDE, and create a new file named `test_cli.sh`. 

### Step 2: Write the Bash Script

Copy and paste the following content into `test_cli.sh`. You'll need to modify this template to fit your CLI's commands and expected outputs.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# A simple Bash script to test cli.py functionality

# Function to test a specific command
test_command() {
    command=$1 # The command to run
    expected_output=$2 # The expected output of the command

    echo "Testing command: $command"
    output=$(python cli.py $command) # Adjust this line if your CLI invocation differs
    if [[ "$output" == *"$expected_output"* ]]; then
        echo "PASS: Command output is as expected."
    else
        echo "FAIL: Command output did not match expectation."
        echo "Expected: $expected_output"
        echo "Got: $output"
    fi
}

# Example test cases
# You should replace these commands and expected outputs with those relevant to your CLI application

# Test 'help' command
test_command "help" "Usage:"

# Test 'version' command
test_command "version" "CLI Version 1.0"

# Add more tests as needed
# test_command "your_command" "expected_output"

```

### Step 3: Make the Script Executable

Before you can run your script, you need to make it executable. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `test_cli.sh`, and run:

```bash
chmod +x test_cli.sh
```

### Step 4: Run the Script

Now, you can run your script to execute the tests:

```bash
./test_cli.sh
```

### Customizing the Script

- **Modify the `test_command` function calls** at the bottom of the script to test your actual CLI commands and their expected outputs. The `test_command` function takes two arguments: the command to test (excluding `python cli.py`, which is already included in the function) and the expected output string.
- **Adjust the `output=$(python cli.py $command)` line** if your CLI requires a different invocation method. For example, if you need to pass arguments in a specific way or if your CLI is not a Python script.
- **Enhance error handling** by capturing and checking the exit status of commands, especially if your CLI returns specific exit codes for different error conditions.

This basic framework provides a starting point for CLI testing. You can extend it with more sophisticated checks, including testing for specific error messages, handling multi-line outputs, and testing with input files or redirection if your CLI supports or requires these features.
