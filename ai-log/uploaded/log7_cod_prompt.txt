Prompt:
give me some tips about making the cli, given this info about its requirements:
"The CLI specification includes calls that are equivalent to those of the REST API. The CLI must be available only from the console (command line, ssh) of the system hosting the application you are building. User accounts, if implemented, are created only through the CLI.
The CLI will support the JSON format and the CSV format, just as in the REST API. The format choice will be specified in an optional parameter as mentioned below. The CLI will be called from the command line with calls to the format:
$ se23XX scope --param1 value1 [--param2 value2 ...] --format fff
Where XX is your group ID and SCOPE as indicated in the table below. In case no parameters are given, the CLI supported parameters for all scopes should be displayed.
The following parameters should be supported per scope."

Creating a command-line interface (CLI) based on your provided specification involves several key considerations. Here are some tips and best practices to help you design and implement your CLI effectively:

1. Understand the REST API Equivalence
Ensure you have a thorough understanding of the REST API your CLI is mirroring. Each CLI command should correspond to a specific REST API endpoint.
Implement the same input validation and error handling as in the REST API.
2. Platform Compatibility
Decide on which platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) your CLI should be compatible.
Use a cross-platform language (like Python, Node.js) if compatibility with multiple platforms is required.
3. User Account Management
Implement user account creation commands if required.
Ensure secure handling of credentials (passwords, tokens) during account creation and authentication.
4. Command Structure and Parameter Parsing
Follow the command format $ se23XX scope --param1 value1 [--param2 value2 ...] --format fff closely.
Use a library for parsing command-line arguments (like argparse in Python, commander in Node.js).
Include optional parameters and handle cases where parameters are omitted.
Provide helpful error messages for incorrect command usage.
5. Support for JSON and CSV Formats
Implement functionality to output data in both JSON and CSV formats.
Use libraries for handling JSON and CSV to simplify implementation (like json in Python, fast-csv in Node.js).
6. Help and Documentation
Implement a help command or option that displays usage instructions and available commands.
Document each command, its purpose, and its parameters thoroughly.
Consider adding examples of command usage in the help section.
7. Testing and Validation
Test each command thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected.
Validate user inputs and handle edge cases gracefully.
8. Security Considerations
If your CLI interacts with sensitive data, implement appropriate security measures (e.g., SSL/TLS for data transmission, secure storage of credentials).
9. User Feedback and Error Handling
Provide clear feedback to the user for successful operations.
Implement comprehensive error handling to catch and report errors in a user-friendly manner.
10. Version Control and Group Collaboration
Use version control (like Git) for collaborative development.
Regularly merge and test changes from different group members to avoid integration issues.
11. Scalability and Maintenance
Write clean, modular code to make future modifications easier.
Consider the scalability of your CLI if the REST API expands or changes.
12. Logging and Monitoring (Optional)
Implement logging to record CLI usage, errors, and significant events.
This can be useful for debugging and monitoring the CLI's performance.
Remember, the key to a successful CLI is not just in

meeting the technical requirements but also in ensuring it is user-friendly and intuitive. Good documentation and clear error messages go a long way in achieving this. Keep testing and iterating based on user feedback to improve the CLI over time.
