How to force logout when closing the tab of my site?Flask
=========================
Github Copilot

In a Flask application, you can't directly detect when a user closes a tab or browser. This is because HTTP is a stateless protocol, and the server doesn't maintain a continuous connection with the client.

However, you can use JavaScript on the client side to send a request to the server when the user closes the tab or browser. This request can then trigger the logout function on the server side.

Here's how you can do it:

Add a JavaScript event listener for the beforeunload event. This event is fired when the window, the document and its resources are about to be unloaded.
In this code, the navigator.sendBeacon method is used to send a request to the /logout endpoint. This method is designed to send small amounts of data to the server without waiting for a response, which makes it suitable for this use case.
<script>
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', function (e) {
    navigator.sendBeacon('/logout');
});
</script>

Create a /logout endpoint in your Flask application that logs out the user.
In this code, the logout_user function is used to log out the user. This function removes the user's ID from the session.

@app.route('/logout', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def logout():
    logout_user()
    return jsonify({"msg": "Logged out"}), 200

Please note that this method is not 100% reliable. The beforeunload event may not be fired in some cases, such as when the browser crashes or the internet connection is lost. Therefore, it's a good practice to also set a reasonable session timeout to automatically log out inactive users.
