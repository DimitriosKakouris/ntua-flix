Prompt:
i want to implement a voting system in my website. I have used radio button with 10 stars for the user to rate the movie that they have selected. What changes do I have to implement in the react frontend? I have already implemented the endpoint in the backend.

To implement a voting system for movies on your website using React, you can follow these steps:

Create the Radio Button Component:
You've mentioned that you're using radio buttons with 10 stars for users to rate the movie. You can create a component for these radio buttons. Here's an example of what the component might look like:

import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MovieRating = ({ movieId, onSubmitRating }) => {
  const [rating, setRating] = useState(null);

  const handleRatingChange = (event) => {
    setRating(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleSubmitRating = () => {
    if (rating !== null) {
      onSubmitRating(movieId, rating);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <label>Rate this movie:</label>
      </div>
      <div>
        {Array.from({ length: 10 }, (_, index) => (
          <label key={index}>
            <input
              type="radio"
              name={`rating_${movieId}`}
              value={index + 1}
              checked={rating === index + 1}
              onChange={handleRatingChange}
            />
            {index + 1} stars
          </label>
        ))}
      </div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={handleSubmitRating}>Submit Rating</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MovieRating;

In this example, the MovieRating component allows users to select a rating from 1 to 10 stars and submit their rating.

Use the MovieRating Component:
In the part of your website where you display movies, import and use the MovieRating component for each movie. Pass the movieId and a callback function that will handle the rating submission. For example:

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import MovieRating from './MovieRating'; // Import the MovieRating component

const MovieList = ({ movies }) => {
  const handleRatingSubmit = (movieId, rating) => {
    // Implement the logic to send the rating to your backend endpoint
    // You may use an HTTP request (e.g., fetch or Axios) to send the data
    // to your backend API endpoint for storing the user's rating.

    // Example:
    // fetch(`/api/movies/${movieId}/rate`, {
    //   method: 'POST',
    //   headers: {
    //     'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    //   },
    //   body: JSON.stringify({ rating }),
    // })
    // .then((response) => {
    //   if (response.ok) {
    //     // Handle successful rating submission
    //   } else {
    //     // Handle errors
    //   }
    // })
    // .catch((error) => {
    //   // Handle network errors
    // });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {movies.map((movie) => (
        <div key={movie.id}>
          <h2>{movie.title}</h2>
          {/* Render the MovieRating component for each movie */}
          <MovieRating movieId={movie.id} onSubmitRating={handleRatingSubmit} />
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MovieList;

In this example, the MovieList component maps over a list of movies and renders the MovieRating component for each movie, passing the movieId and the handleRatingSubmit callback function.

Backend Integration:
You mentioned that you've already implemented the backend endpoint for rating submission. Ensure that the frontend makes a POST request to this endpoint with the movie ID and the user's rating when the "Submit Rating" button is clicked. Handle the response from the backend accordingly, such as showing a success message or handling errors.

Styling:
You can add CSS or styles to make the rating component visually appealing and user-friendly. You can use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for styling, or create your own custom styles.

By following these steps, you can implement a movie rating system in your React frontend that allows users to rate movies using radio buttons with 10 stars and submit their ratings to the backend.
