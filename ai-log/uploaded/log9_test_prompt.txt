Î™s there performance hit in the response time of the server if i do the testing through cli or js in postman?

When performing API testing, whether through a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool (like `curl` or Postman's CLI tool Newman) or using JavaScript within Postman itself, any performance impact on the server's response time should be minimal and similar across both methods, assuming you're making the same requests with equivalent payloads and frequencies. However, there are a few nuances to consider:

### Network Overhead
- **CLI Tools** and **Postman (JS)**: The network overhead should be comparable for both CLI tools and Postman when making HTTP requests. The time taken to send a request and receive a response is primarily dependent on network conditions, server processing time, and the size of the request and response.

### Client-Side Processing
- **Postman (JS)**: JavaScript tests in Postman run after the response is received, meaning the testing logic itself doesn't affect the network request/response cycle. However, complex JavaScript tests can increase the total time you observe from sending the request to finishing the processing of the test scripts. This doesn't affect the server's response time but can affect the overall time you perceive for a request to be processed and tested within Postman.
- **CLI Tools**: Similar to Postman, any processing or parsing of responses in CLI scripts (e.g., using `jq` for JSON processing) occurs after the response has been received, affecting only client-side processing time.

### Concurrent Requests
- If you're sending a large number of requests concurrently (stress testing), both methods can increase server load, potentially affecting response times. However, this impact is a result of the testing strategy rather than the tool used.

### Specific Tool Overheads
- Both Postman and CLI tools have some overhead for initializing the request and processing the response. For CLI tools, this overhead is generally minimal. Postman might have slightly more overhead due to its graphical interface and features, but this is more relevant to the client-side experience rather than affecting server response time.

### Environment and Execution
- **CLI Tools** might be executed in various environments (local machine, CI/CD pipelines) where the computing resources and network conditions can differ significantly. These factors can influence the perceived performance but not the server's actual response time to the requests.
- **Postman's Execution Environment**: When using Postman, whether you're running it on a powerful desktop or a less capable laptop can influence how quickly Postman can send requests and process responses, again affecting only the client-side experience.

### Conclusion
The method of testing (CLI vs. JavaScript in Postman) primarily affects client-side execution times and resource usage rather than the server's response time to requests. For accurate server response time measurements, consider using server-side logging or monitoring tools that can provide metrics unaffected by client-side processing.
