ChatGPT:

To implement a movie search using the TMDB API in a Python-Flask application, you'll need to follow these steps:

Set up your Flask application: If you haven't already, set up a basic Flask application.

Get an API key from TMDB: Sign up for an account on TMDB and get your API key as described in their getting started guide.

Implement the search functionality: You'll need to create a route in your Flask application that handles the search requests and queries the TMDB API.

Here's a basic code snippet to guide you through this process:


from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

TMDB_API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'  # Replace with your TMDB API Key
TMDB_SEARCH_URL = 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie'

@app.route('/search')
def search_movies():
    query = request.args.get('query')
    if not query:
        return jsonify({'error': 'No search query provided'}), 400

    params = {
        'api_key': TMDB_API_KEY,
        'query': query
    }
    
    response = requests.get(TMDB_SEARCH_URL, params=params)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Failed to fetch data from TMDB'}), 500

    return jsonify(response.json())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
This code does the following:

Sets up a basic Flask application.
Defines a route /search that takes a query parameter.
Sends a request to the TMDB search API with the provided query.
Returns the JSON response from the TMDB API.
To use this, replace 'your_api_key_here' with your actual TMDB API key. Then you can start the Flask app, and use a URL like http://localhost:5000/search?query=Inception to search for movies.

Remember to handle API rate limits and errors in a production environment. Also, consider securing your API key and not exposing it in your source code directly.
