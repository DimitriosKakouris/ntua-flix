To create a UML sequence diagram for a user login process, you'll depict interactions between the User, LoginController, and Database. The process starts with the User sending login details, which are received by the LoginController. 
The controller then validates these details with the Database. If the credentials are correct, the Database sends a confirmation back to the LoginController, which then allows the User to log in.
