Should I do separate testing with postman and cli tool?

Whether you should do separate testing with Postman and a CLI tool depends on several factors, including your project requirements, the nature of your API, your development workflow, and the testing coverage you need to achieve. Here are some considerations to help you decide:

### 1. **Different Testing Contexts**

- **Postman** is primarily used for manual testing and automation through its collection runner and Newman, its command-line companion. It's excellent for API exploration, manual testing, and sharing collections across teams. Postman allows for easy setup of environment variables, pre-request scripts, and tests that can validate the response data, structure, and performance.
  
- **CLI Tools** (like `curl`, HTTPie, or custom CLI applications) are useful for quick tests, scripting, and situations where you might need to integrate API calls into shell scripts or CI/CD pipelines. CLI testing can also be essential for testing in environments where a GUI is not available.

### 2. **Use Cases**

- **Development and Debugging**: During the development phase, you might prefer Postman for its user-friendly interface and extensive features for exploring APIs and debugging.
  
- **Automation and CI/CD Integration**: For integrating tests into continuous integration and delivery pipelines, CLI tools might be more appropriate. Automated tests can run as part of your CI/CD process, ensuring that any new changes don't break existing functionality.

### 3. **Consistency Across Environments**

- Testing with both Postman and a CLI tool can help ensure your API behaves consistently across different environments and interfaces. For instance, what works in Postman should also work when called from a CLI tool, and vice versa. This can be particularly important for public APIs or when supporting a wide range of clients.

### 4. **Coverage and Efficiency**

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Using both methods can increase your testing coverage, catching issues that might be missed when relying on a single approach.
  
- **Efficiency**: Consider the efficiency of your testing strategy. If certain tests are easier to perform or automate with one tool over the other, it might make sense to focus your efforts there.

### 5. **Learning Curve and Tooling**

- The choice might also depend on your team's familiarity with the tools and the learning curve associated with them. While Postman is relatively easy to pick up for people with varying levels of technical expertise, CLI tools may require a stronger background in command-line operations and scripting.

### Conclusion

In many cases, a combination of both Postman and CLI tools offers the best of both worlds, providing a comprehensive testing framework that leverages the strengths of each tool. However, the decision should be based on your specific project needs, resource availability, and the preferences of your development and QA teams. If resources are limited, prioritize the tool that best fits your immediate testing needs and workflows, keeping in mind the potential benefits of incorporating additional tools in the future.
